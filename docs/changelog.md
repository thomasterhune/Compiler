- added #pragma region directives to header files. This is basically just markup for VSCode. Each of these regions can now be folded in Visual Studio or VSCode. This does not affect -ansi compilation on MinGW-W64 gcc; as far as I can tell. The purpose is to make the code much easier to navigate without relying on tab-based folding.

- Cleaned up comments, tab-based folding, etc.
- Fixed up the `addExtension` to use malloc to create a longer, concatenated string out of its inputs. Added unit tests for `addExtension`.

- created `promptUserOverwriteSelection`.
- created tests for `promptUserOverwriteSelection`. This was quite an involved task because we had to figure out how to temporarily replace stdin and stdout with alternative files so that we could test functionalities like `scanf`. Ultimately we were able to figure it out.
